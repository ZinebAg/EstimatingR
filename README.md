# EstimatingR
This a semester project for my Bachelor. The main motivation behind this project is to accurately the effective reproductive number $R_t$ in Switzerland using data displayed each day on the number of reported cases, the number of hospitalizations and the numberof deaths.  Our goal is to understand in details how the Swiss estimates are constructed and to survey existing improvements for the method used.  We also aim to simulate the spread and understand different aspects:  estimation and prediction of the rate of hospitalization, the rate of death and therate of asymptomatic cases.

The codes displayed below were mainly inspired by the article: < Xingjie Hao et al. “Reconstruction of the full transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in Wuhan” >, some other features are added later on.

To use the code replace "-----/" by your directory for the cases present in the repository and "...../" by the directory of the file where the plots will show.
